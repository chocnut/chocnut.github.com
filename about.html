Hi I'm Peter Indiola and I'm currently a freelance web developer base on Pasig City, Philippines. Since I don't have a self hosting server and domain name yet. I setup temporarly this blog using <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap" target="_blank">Jekyll Bootstrap</a>. This is where I'll put all my code snippets and programming tips and tricks that might wort sharing.
